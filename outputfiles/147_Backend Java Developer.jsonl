{"text": "Backend Java Developer\t"}
{"text": "Description: PayPal is an international e-commerce business allowing payments and money transfers to be made through the Internet. Onboarding Platform exposes RESTful APIs through which Front Tier components, Batches, API callers, Partners, Developers, Mobile apps etc. can onboard customers. It is a coarse grained API to be able to serve different kinds of use-cases and customer onboardings via a single interface. The actual contract is in the HTTP message whose schema and format varies depending on the type of use-cases. The Onboarding platform imposes very little or no restrictions on its clients in terms of how they interact with the platform. Clients can be very chatty with the platform and send data incrementally to the platform or if they choose, call the platform at the end as if they were making an API call. The platform supports both interaction models and all the others in between.When a new customer comes to Paypal and expresses an intent on what they want to use Paypal for, it initiates an onboarding flow. Based on the customer intent, it creates an account or no. Behind the scenes, onboarding platform is an orchestration engine. It coordinates with various core and peer mid tier services. The coordination is expressed as a workflow which is defined based on the intents the customer started with. Customer\u2019s data is persisted in respective domains. Core domains that Onboarding is dependent upon are \"Risk, Compliance, User, Merchant and FI\"."}
