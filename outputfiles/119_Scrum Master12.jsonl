{"text": "United Health Group Inc. is an American for-profit managed health care company which offers health care products and insurance services. The healthcare unit has 4 divisions and the focus here was on Medicare and Retirement. The product in question here is COMPAS. It is an ensemble online application taking care of enrollment, fulfilment, letter writing, agents etc. COMPAS also communicates with various systems. Some of these are AVAYA and OPTUM. I have been involved as a Scrum master for 3 teams with the following projects, spanning one product:"}
{"text": "Avaya: With AVAYA, COMPAS receives a bulk of users registered during the Annual Enrollment period (AEP). COMPAS then sends an outbound file to AVAYA - which makes automated calls to those users. Upon validation, AVAYA sends a disposition file back to COMPAS and it is processed and stored there. OPTUM: With OPTUM, it is a multi-factor authentication (MF) project. COMPAS already had SiteMinder for authentication purposes, but decided to add a more secure authentication system through OPTUM. The Employer web and Provider web users register first and are then added to the Work Queue. Every time a login attempt is made through EWEB/PWEB, OPTUM takes over and validates with the information in its database and also provides yet another layer of authentication with an access code to be entered (sent to registered phone number/ email ID). "}
{"text": "COMPAS-Portfolio: COMPAS in itself needed work in the form of upgrades. It was using Java 1.7 and we were upgrading it to 1.8. It was of pivotal importance that all the functionalities work fine with the upgrade and issues are resolved. As a consequence of the upgrade, fortify issues had to be fixed as well and MF would then be merged with Portfolio. "}
